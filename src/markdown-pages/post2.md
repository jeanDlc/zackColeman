Every writer I know who has lasted in the publishing industry for more than five years has one thing in common: a support system that functions on multiple levels. Everything about this industry—querying agents, sending stories out on submission, the erratic way in which we get paid, etc.—is designed to weed writers out and wear us down. But those of us with multi-level support are more likely to weather the storms of self-doubt.   

There are three key types of support for writers:  
1. Mentorship: People ahead of you in their career who inspire you.
2. Critique: People who offer feedback on your writing in exchange for your feedback on theirs.
3. Accountability: People who help keep you on track for your writing and career goals.  


The key to emotional well-being and continued productivity is knowing which part of your support system to call on and when. Once you start looking you can find support everywhere: from writers and non-writers, people you may never meet in real life, or authors who don’t even know you exist.

## Mentorship: Three Levels
Are you looking for motivation and inspiration? Find yourself a writing mentor. The great part is you don’t even have to be able to access that person in real life.
I have mentors on three levels.


### Rockstar Titans
These are writers like Neil Gaiman, V.E. Schwab, and Stephen King. These mentors from afar are the authors with million-dollar book deals and fans who tattoo their quotes onto their flesh. If I were fortunate enough to be in the same room with a Titan, I likely wouldn’t be able to speak to them out loud with my words  

### Writing Geniuses 
These are authors five to ten years ahead of me in their careers. And yes, they’ve amassed awards and published multiple books, but they still walk the same streets as mere mortal me. If I encounter a Writing Genius in real life I could probably muster the courage to talk to them.
